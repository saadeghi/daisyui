        Thank you for submitting a bug report üíö
        If you need help about your project and it's **NOT** a daisyUI bug, please [ask your question in discussion forum](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/discussions/new?category=q-a).

        üëâ Before you submit a new bug, please do the following steps:

        1. Update your daisyUI (and other dependencies) to the latest version (`npm i -D daisyui@latest`)
        2. Read [FAQ](https://daisyui.com/docs/faq/). You may find a solution there
        3. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [discussion forum](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/discussions?discussions_q=). You may find a solution there
        4. Make sure this bug is **NOT** specific to a JS framework or a build tool. If the issue doesn't happen on [Tailwind Play](https://daisyui.com/tailwindplay/) it means it's not an issue from daisyUI.
        It can be a config problem in your project ([ask here](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/discussions?discussions_q=)) or it can be an issue from your framework or CSS build tools.
        5. Open one issue per problem. Don't list multiple issues in the same page because that would be hard to track.
