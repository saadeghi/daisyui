## 5.0.0

> This is the detailed list of changes per component. Most of these changes won't affect your project, so if you want to learn about the breaking changes only, [check out the daisyUI 5 release notes](/docs/v5/)

### Alert

🆕 Additions
- Added `alert-outline`, `alert-dash`, and `alert-soft` variants.
- Added `alert-vertical` and `alert-horizontal` layout options.

🔧 Changes
- Instead of hardcoded responsive breakpoints, you can now use the `max-sm:alert-horizontal` or any other responsive breakpoint.

### Artboard

🗑️ Removals
- **Breaking Change:** Removed all `artboard` and `phone-*` classes. These classes were simply setting the width and height of the div. Use Tailwind CSS `w-*` and `h-*` classes instead.

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `artboard phone-1` | `w-[320px] h-[568px]` |
| `artboard phone-2` | `w-[375px] h-[667px]` |
| `artboard phone-3` | `w-[414px] h-[736px]` |
| `artboard phone-4` | `w-[375px] h-[812px]` |
| `artboard phone-5` | `w-[414px] h-[896px]` |
| `artboard phone-6` | `w-[320px] h-[1024px]` |

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-1` | `w-[568px] h-[320px]` |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-2` | `w-[667px] h-[375px]` |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-3` | `w-[736px] h-[414px]` |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-4` | `w-[812px] h-[375px]` |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-5` | `w-[896px] h-[414px]` |
| `artboard artboard-horizontal phone-6` | `w-[1024px] h-[320px]` |

```diff:page.html
- <div class="artboard phone-1">
+ <div class="w-[320px] h-[568px]">
```

To be clear, `mockup-phone` is not removed. It just doesn't need the `artboard` class anymore.

### Avatar

🔧 Changes
- **Breaking Change:** Renamed `online` class to `avatar-online`, `offline` to `avatar-offline`, and `placeholder` to `avatar-placeholder`.

```diff:page.html
- <div class="avatar online">
+ <div class="avatar avatar-online">
  <div class="w-24 rounded-full">
    <img src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.webp" />
  </div>
</div>
```
```diff:page.html
- <div class="avatar offline">
+ <div class="avatar avatar-offline">
  <div class="w-24 rounded-full">
    <img src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.webp" />
  </div>
</div>
```


### Badge

🆕 Additions
- Added `badge-dash`, and `badge-soft` styles.
- Added `badge-xl` size.
- Added a default `gap-2` between content of badge so you don't have to add it manually to put a space between the text and icon.

🔧 Changes
- Adjusted sizes based on the new scale.

### Breadcrumbs

🆕 Additions
- Added a default `gap-2` for the element inside list item so you don't have to add it manually to put a space between the text and icon.

### Bottom Navigation

🗑️ Removals
- **Breaking Change:** Removed `bottom-nav` component. Use [`dock`](/components/dock/) component instead.
- **Breaking Change:** Removed `btm-nav-xs`, `btm-nav-sm`, `btm-nav-md`, `btm-nav-lg`. Use `dock-xs`, `dock-sm`, `dock-md`, `dock-lg` instead.
- **Breaking Change:** Removed `btm-nav-active`. Use `dock-active` instead.
- **Breaking Change:** Removed `disabled` class of `bottom-nav`. Use `aria-disabled="true"` attribute or `disabled` attribute if it's a button. This is for better accessibility.

```diff:page.html
- <div class="btm-nav btm-nav-sm">
+ <div class="dock dock-sm">
  <button>🏠</button>
-   <button class="active">🍿</button>
+   <button class="dock-active">🍿</button>

</div>

- **Breaking Change:** Default height reduced; customizable via `--size-field`.
- checked button (checkbox, radio) now has outline instead of forced primary color. This allows customization like `checked:btn-secondary`
- `btn-ghost` hover style is changed. In v4 `btn-ghost` had a specific hover style overriding any color modification. For example in `btn btn-ghost btn-primary` the button would'nt look primary. In v5 `btn-ghost` now looks as a ghost only before hover. It shows the original color on hover.

### Card

🆕 Additions
- Added `card-border` and `card-dash` styles which adapts the border width from the theme.
- Added support for different card sizes (`card-xs`, `card-sm`, `card-md`, `card-lg`, `card-xl`).
- Allow `<label class="card">` to be used as a radio card. If a checkbox or radio is directly inside a card, clicking the card will toggle the checkbox/radio and will show an outline around the card.

- Adjusted padding in card body.

```diff:page.html

- Added support for the new CSS [`Anchor positioning`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) (Currently only works on Chromium-based browsers. Other browsers will position the dropdown on the middle of the screen, like a modal).

You can customize those according to [`@tailwindcss/typography` config](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) If you want other modifications from v4, [Here's the CSS](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/blob/ff313a45cea023c852903138ea032ac2d0a217f4/src/components/styled/typography.css#L1)

### Other removals

#### 🗑️ Remove form-control, label-text, label-text-alt

You can still use the same HTML still, but class names don't exist anymore and won't apply color, font-size, flex, etc.  
I suggest using the newly added class names for `fieldset` and `legend` elements for better accessibility.

<div class="before-after">

```html:before
<label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
  Login
  <div class="label">
    <span class="label-text">Name</span>
  </div>
  <input class="input" placeholder="Name" />
</label>
```

```html:after
<fieldset class="fieldset">
  <legend>Login</legend>
  <label class="label" for="name">Name</label>
  <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
</fieldset>
```

</div>

<div class="before-after">

```html:before
<label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
  <div class="label">
    <span class="label-text">What is your name?</span>
    <span class="label-text-alt">Top Right label</span>
  </div>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Type here" class="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs" />
  <div class="label">
    <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Left label</span>
    <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Right label</span>
  </div>
</label>
```

```html:after
<fieldset class="fieldset max-w-xs">
  <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">
    <span>What is your name?</span>
    <span>Top Right label</span>
  </label>
  <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
  <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">
    <span>Bottom Left label</span>
    <span>Bottom Right label</span>
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

</div>

#### 🗑️ Remove btn-group and input-group

btn-group, input-group were deprecated a year ago and now finally removed.  
If you've been using btn-group or input-group, you can use `join` instead

<div class="before-after">

```html:before
<div class="btn-group">
  <button class="btn">Button 1</button>
  <button class="btn">Button 2</button>
</div>
```

```html:after
<div class="join">
  <button class="btn join-item">Button 1</button>
  <button class="btn join-item">Button 2</button>
</div>
```

</div>
