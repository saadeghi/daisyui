Building an admin dashboard isn’t easy. Developers need responsive designs that work across frameworks. Buyers want something simple, flexible, and easy to customize. It’s hard to get all of that right. We solve those problems. 

## Nexus 2.2 is here! Admin and client dashboard template

- You can purchase the Nexus Dashboard from the [daisyUI store](https://daisyui.com/store/244268/) and follow installations steps to set it up.
- If you already purchased, get the new version for free from https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders

## Dev Story

It started with React and Next.js, building out the basics like an ecommerce dashboard, file manager, and a few core components. Then came the HTML version, more ecommerce pages, and chart support.
SvelteKit followed with a CRM dashboard, cleaner forms, and improved components.

Now with v2.2, it's moving into Gen AI with new pages, a fresh dashboard, and a built-in calendar.

Each update includes the latest dependencies and fixes for any bugs we've found or that others have reported. Check out the official [Nexus docs](https://nexus.daisyui.com/docs/) for the changelog and upcoming plans.

## Installation

Nexus supports all Node.js versions above 18 and has been thoroughly tested. It also works seamlessly with all package managers (npm, yarn, bun), so you can use your preferred one.

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server (This will run your project in development mode):

```bash
npm run dev
``` 

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
``` 

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
``` 

## Customization

### Changing the logo

To change the logo, replace the following images with your own.

- `/public/images/logo/logo-light.png`
- `/public/images/logo/logo-dark.png`

### Customizing daisyUI themes

`/styles/daisyui.css` contains the DaisyUI plugin and themes. You can add or modify themes and their options, including layout colors (background, sidebar, and topbar).

```css
@plugin "daisyui" {
    /* daisyUI options */
}

@plugin "daisyui/theme" {
    name: "light";

    /* update: primary */
    --color-primary: #167bff;
    --color-primary-content: #ffffff;
    /* ... */

    /* update: layout */
    --layout-background: #fafbfc;
    --layout-sidebar-background: #ffffff;
    --layout-topbar-background: #ffffff;
}

/* add: new theme here */
```

We've customized some DaisyUI styles. To match Nexus exactly, copy styles/custom/components.css into your project.

### Change the font

`/styles/typography.css` contains all typography-related styles. We use Google Fonts (@import url('...')) for the font family, which you can change to your preference.

```css
/* update: font family url */
@import url("https://..."); 

@theme {
    /* update: font family variable */
    --font-body: "DM Sans", sans-serif;
    
     /* update: font size */
    --text-sm: 14px;       
    --text-base: 16px;
    
    /* add: more options related to font  */
}
```

### Customizing the dashboard layout

`/styles/custom/layout.css` contains the layout CSS, where you can modify all aspects related to the admin layout, including the sidebar, topbar, rightbar, and content area.

```css
:root {
    /* update: sidebar width,as you want */
    --layout-sidebar-width: 256px;
}

/* update: layout related styles ... */
```

### Customizing styles

Inside `/styles/custom/**` folder:

- `layout.css` contains the styles for the topbar, sidebar, rightbar.
- `animation.css` includes all animation keyframes and utilities.
  `components.css` contains minor overrides to DaisyUI components. If you don't need any overrides, you can remove this file.
- `plugins.css` handles plugin overrides, ensuring compatibility with other plugins' themes, matching Nexus and DaisyUI styles.
- `iconify.js` is the plugin for Iconify, allowing you to add additional [icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).


## How to use style into your project

_**Note:** All styles (CSS) are defined in the `styles/**` folder, so you can refer to that for styling and use them directly in your project._

Ensure that Tailwind CSS 4 and DaisyUI 5 are properly installed and functioning correctly.

### Include a specific theme

If you need to use the `material` theme in your project, copy the following lines from `styles/daisyui.css` into your project.

```css
@plugin "daisyui/theme" {
    name: "material";
    color-scheme: light;
    --color-primary: #167bff;
    /* ... */
}
```

You can now apply the theme by setting the `data-theme="material"` attribute on the HTML tag.
