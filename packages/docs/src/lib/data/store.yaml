    faq:
      - Q: Can I use this template without Lemon Squeezy?
        A: If the Lemon Squeezy API key is not provided, the data will come from the local JSON file. So you can use the template without Lemon Squeezy, using a static JSON file, and for checkout and payment you can use your own solution.
