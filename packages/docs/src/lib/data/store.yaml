    title: Online Store template
    desc: >-
      **Fully functional LemonSqueezy store template made with daisyUI**


      Made with daisyUI and Next.js 15


      Add your **LemonSqueezy API key** to the env file, add custom data for your products and your online store will be ready in **less than 5 minutes**!


      This template receives your simple list of products coming from the LemonSqueezy API, adds your custom data and attributes to the products and generates a functional online store with all the standard online store capabilities you need.


      Including Homepage, collections page with filter and sort, product page with image gallery, zoom, custom attributes, variant links, related product suggestions and more.
    faq:
      - Q: Can I use this template without Lemon Squeezy?
        A: If the Lemon Squeezy API key is not provided, the data will come from the local JSON file. So you can use the template without Lemon Squeezy, using a static JSON file, and for checkout and payment you can use your own solution.
