Getting a school project up and running can be stressful, especially when you just want something that works and looks good. Most component libraries make things harder than they need to be:

- Complicated setup steps and lots of dependencies
- Locked into a specific framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Heavy bundle sizes that slow down your project
- Customization is confusing or limited

All of this is overkill for a simple project or assignment.

## Why daisyUI is perfect for school projects

daisyUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, but it’s much easier to use. You get ready-made components, simple class names, and you don’t have to worry about JavaScript or framework lock-in. You can get started in minutes, not hours.


- Works with plain HTML, no build tools required
- No extra dependencies or complex configs
- Easy to customize and theme
- Lightweight and fast

## Quick setup with CDN (no build tools needed)

Just copy and paste this into your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My School Project</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
  </head>
  <body class="p-8">
    <button class="btn">Hello, world!</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

That’s it. You’re ready to use all of daisyUI’s components and Tailwind’s utility classes right away.

If you want to build a project quickly and avoid the usual headaches, daisyUI is a great choice for school assignments.
