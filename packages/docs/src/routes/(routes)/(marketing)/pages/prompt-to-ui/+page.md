## Prompt-to-UI works when prompts name components

[Prompt-to-UI tools](/pages/generate-ui-from-text/) fail when the prompt describes outcomes but not building blocks. "Make it professional" gives the model taste work. "Use cards, stats, tabs, and primary buttons" gives it structure.

The best prompts do not micromanage every pixel. They name the parts the UI should use and leave the model to assemble them.

## The hidden cost is not the first screen

The first version often looks acceptable. The maintenance cost shows up in the second, fifth, and tenth edit.

- One button becomes five different button class strings.
- A card uses different padding on each page.
- Dark mode colors get copied by hand.
- The model changes nearby styles while fixing one small detail.
- Reviewing the diff takes longer than the prompt.

This is a prompt design problem. The model needs constraints that are specific enough to guide output but broad enough to keep the workflow fast.

## Give the model component names before it writes code

Semantic classes narrow the search space. Instead of asking AI to invent a button from utilities, give it a known target:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
```

The same idea works across a page:

```html
<section class="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-3!">
  <div class="card bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h2 class="card-title">Team usage</h2>
      <p>See seats, invites, and plan limits in one place.</p>
      <div class="card-actions justify-end">
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Manage</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Now the prompt and the code share the same vocabulary. You can ask for "primary", "outline", "warning", "compact", or "ghost" instead of asking the model to rebuild color, border, spacing, hover, active, disabled, and focus styles.

## Why daisyUI fits prompt-to-UI workflows

daisyUI is a Tailwind CSS component library. Version 5 installs with `@plugin "daisyui"`, includes 61 component families in this repo, ships 35 built-in themes, and can also be used from CDN with `@tailwindcss/browser@4` for quick HTML prototypes. It adds CSS class names. It does not ship React, Vue, or Svelte components, so your framework keeps control of state and behavior.

That combination matters for [generated UI](/pages/generate-ui-from-text/). Tailwind CSS remains available for layout and one-off styling, while daisyUI handles repeated interface parts with names a model can reuse: `btn`, `card`, `input`, `select`, `modal`, `navbar`, `menu`, `table`, `badge`, `alert`, `stat`, and `toast`.

The model still has freedom. It can choose the layout, data, copy, and interaction wiring. The repetitive visual layer has a stable vocabulary.

## A better prompt pattern

Use prompts that name the components before the style:

```text
Build a settings page with daisyUI.
Use cards for sections, fieldsets for form groups, inputs for text fields,
selects for option lists, and btn-primary for the main action.
Use Tailwind utilities only for layout and spacing.
```

That prompt gives the model pieces it can assemble. It also gives you code that is easier to review because the important UI decisions are visible in class names.

## When this approach pays off

Use semantic components when prompts will drive repeated edits. The clearer the vocabulary, the less the model has to guess.

Start with the [daisyUI components](/components/), then keep the [install guide](/docs/install/) and [theme generator](/theme-generator/) close while you prompt. The less the model has to invent, the more attention it can spend on the screen you asked for.
