[daisyui.com/llms.txt](https://daisyui.com/llms.txt) file is a compact, text version of daisyUI docs to help AI generate accurate daisyUI code based on your prompt.  
Here's how to use daisyUI llms.txt in Zed:

### Quick use

- In Thread chat type this before your prompt
  ```md:prompt
  @fetch https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
  ```
- Or in Text thread chat type this before your prompt
  ```md:prompt
  /fetch https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
  ```

### MCP server

MCP is an API to communicate with AI models. You can add MCP servers to your code editor and Cursor will communicate with them to get more accurate results.

I suggest using [Context7](https://context7.com/) [MCP server](https://github.com/upstash/context7-mcp) which provides many libraries including daisyUI.

1. Press <kbd class="kbd">⌘ CMD</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">P</kbd> (or <kbd class="kbd">⌃ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd">P</kbd> on Windows)
2. Type `agent: add context server`
3. Add this name and server:

   ```sh:name
   context7
   ```

   ```sh:server
   npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
   ```

4. Now in `Agent Mode` you can ask AI anything about daisyUI, and write `use context7` at the end of your prompt.  
    For example:
   ```md:prompt
   give me a light daisyUI 5 theme with tropical color palette. use context7
   ```
