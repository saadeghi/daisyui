Hey!  
[Pouya](http://github.com/saadeghi) here, the creator of daisyUI 🌼

2025 was a big year for daisyUI. We had a big release, massive improvements, new tools, and we watched the community grow in ways that still surprise me, in a good way. Thank you to everyone who used the library, opened issues, and sent bug fixes and ideas.

## Stats from 2025

- 📦 daisyUI had `22,000,000` NPM downloads this year, which is a `70%` jump over the `13,000,000` downloads in 2024. Our weekly downloads are around `530,000` now. This is apart from downloads from CDN websites or direct downloads from GitHub, so the real stats for daisyUI usage are even higher but hard to track!
- 🌐 daisyUI is now used in `428,000` open source projects on GitHub, up `28.5%` from `333,000` last year. Including projects from big companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Alibaba, Adobe and more.

## 2025 recap

- daisyUI 5 was released in early 2025. The v5 release notes are available at [/docs/v5/]( /docs/v5/ ). Then we had 4 minor releases with new features and many patch versions fixing bugs and improving the library.
- We added `12` new components and `3` new themes.
- The new Theme Generator helps you design daisyUI themes and export them easily [/theme-generator/]( /theme-generator/ ).
- We released the second version of the Official daisyUI Figma Library to help designers and developers be on the same page, find it in the [daisyUI Store](/store/daisyui-figma-library/).
- The official daisyUI MCP server, Blueprint, is now available at [/blueprint/]( /blueprint/ ). It's great for generating accurate and production-ready Tailwind + daisyUI code.
- We added `llms.txt` to help LLMs understand daisyUI better: [/llms.txt]( /llms.txt ).
- Four new templates landed on the [daisyUI Store](/store/), and we also launched [daisyUI Swag](https://swag.daisyui.com/) where you can get high-quality merch from daisyUI!

## Community and ecosystem

daisyUI became the default UI library for the Elixir Phoenix framework this year. If you use Phoenix, check the install guide at [/docs/install/phoenix/]( /docs/install/phoenix/ ).

Seeing more projects adopt daisyUI across different stacks has been incredibly motivating. The PRs, bug reports, and design suggestions you send make the project better for everyone.

## Accessibility, docs, UX improvements

We kept improving accessibility and the docs. Examples are clearer, include ARIA patterns when needed, and are easier to use in a real projects. The site also got a number of UX improvements so you can find components, themes, and templates faster.

If you haven't tried the daisyUI Theme Generator yet, they're a quick way to create and export daisyUI themes: [/theme-generator/]( /theme-generator/).

## Blueprint: The Official daisyUI MCP server

The official daisyUI MCP server, Blueprint, is now available at [/blueprint/]( /blueprint/ ). It's the best tool for generating accurate and production-ready Tailwind + daisyUI code.

It works with VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code and any other IDEs that support MCP servers.

## What's next?

We will be adding more components and features in 2026. daisyUI 6 is expected to be released 2026 with more new features and improvements. daisyUI products such as the Figma library, daisyUI templates and Blueprint will all get updates and new features to make your development experience even better.  
There are A LOT of new and exciting stuff being added to CSS and HTML recently and we will use them to make daisyUI even more powerful!
