Welcome! 🎉

daisyUI, the essential component library for Tailwind CSS is now being used in [360,000 open source projects](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/network/dependents), with 19 million npm installs (350 thousand weekly installs). daisyUI is growing faster than before and today it's helping many people, startups and companies to create improve their development experience.  

💚 daisyUI became possible thanks to your incredible contributions, helpful feedback, and amazing support. Thank you!

Since the release of daisyUI 4 in 2023, a lot of feedback, feature requests, and bug reports have been received. Big efforts went into preparing daisyUI for this major release, using the latest web standards and new CSS/HTML features, as well as all the amazing new Tailwind CSS 4 features.

Here's daisyUI 5 with a lot of new features, improvements, and bug fixes. It's a huge update, I added TLDR for each section to make it easier to read.

## 1. Core Improvement

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – daisyUI 5 is compatible with Tailwind CSS 4, has zero dependencies, a smaller package size, smaller CSS size, and is more customizable. CSS variables are now more readable and more flexible.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#2-build-and-integration-improvements)

### Tailwind CSS 4 compatibility

Tailwind CSS 4 is crazy good! A lot of new features and improvements are added and also many changes to the plugin API.

daisyUI 5 works with Tailwind CSS 4 and takes advantage of all the new features.

With Tailwind CSS 4, you can now import daisyUI as a plugin in the CSS file.

<div class="before-after">

```js:Before
// tailwind.config.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui');
  ],
}
```
```postcss:After
/* app.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "daisyui";





```
</div>

See [Tailwind CSS upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) for more information.

### Zero dependencies

Reducing the number of dependencies in your project is important for many reasons. It leads to faster build times and better performance in your workflow. Fewer dependencies also make your app more secure by reducing the chance of potential for vulnerabilities from less maintained packages. Also, managing a smaller dependency tree makes maintenance easier and reduces the chance of deprecation problems or version conflict in the long term.

Last year I reduced the number of dependencies in daisyUI, from ~100 (dependencies + sub dependencies in total) to 7!

This time we got rid of all the remaining ones!  
daisyUI 5 has no dependencies. Hopefully this helps to clean up your node_modules a little bit.

<div class="before-after">

```js:Before
Dependencies - Total 1.8 MB on disk (250 files)
  ├╴ culori
  ├╴ picocolors
  ├╴ postcss-js
  │  ╰╴ camelcase-css
  ╰╴ css-selector-tokenizer
     ├╴ cssesc
     ╰╴ fastparse
```
```js:After
No dependencies - 0 kB








```
</div>

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/nature.webp" alt="daisyui-package">


### Smaller size

With daisyUI as a Tailwind CSS plugin, only the needed styles are included in the final CSS file. Other than that we have made a lot of optimizations to make both package size and CSS file size smaller.

daisyUI 5 NPM package is 61% smaller in size.

<dl class="before-after">
  <dt>Before</dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      Install size – 4.7 MB
      <br/>
      <progress class="progress progress-error" value="4.7" max="5.1"></progress>
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>After</dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      Install size – 1.8 MB
      <br/>
      <progress class="progress progress-success" value="1.8" max="5.1"></progress>
    </div>
  </dd>
</dl>

daisyUI 5 CDN file, including all possible class names, is 75% smaller in size

<dl class="before-after">
  <dt>Before</dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      full.css – 137 kB compressed
      <br/>
      <progress class="progress progress-error" value="137" max="145"></progress>
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt>After</dt>
  <dd>
    <div>
      daisyui.css – 34 kB compressed
      <br/>
      <progress class="progress progress-success" value="34" max="145"></progress>
    </div>
  </dd>
</dl>

It is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5. This is the smallest size ever for the daisyUI CDN file, including all the possible daisyUI components and colors, available for all Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes. This is a CSS file, minified, compressed and cached on CDN.

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/daisyui-5-cdn-size.webp" alt="daisyui 5 cdn size">


### Improved color variables

With Tailwind CSS 3 and daisyUI 4, we had to extract the color values of each color into CSS variables, and pass it to Tailwind CSS alongside a special `<alpha-value>` variable so Tailwind CSS could generate opacity variables for each color utility class.

Tailwind CSS 4 doesn't have this limitation because it uses CSS `color-mix()` to control the opacity.

With daisyUI 5 we can finally put the whole color inside CSS variables. All color formats are supported, no transformation is needed no JS object is needed.

We also updated the variable names to be more readable in the output CSS, which means you can even customize the color values using the browser dev tools color picker.

<div class="before-after">

```css:Before
/* hard to read variable names, hard to customize values */

## 2. Build and integration improvements

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – Import only the parts you need.  
> Micro CSS files are now available for no-build projects.  
> Native CSS nesting reduces CSS size.  
> It's ESM compatible and has dependency-free class name prefixing.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#3-design-system-improvements)

### Native CSS nesting

CSS nesting is now supported on all browsers. daisyUI 5 uses CSS nesting which prevents duplication of CSS rules and results smaller CSS size in your browser!

### ESM compatibility

daisyUI 5 is now ESM (ECMAScript Module) compatible. Which means you can import and use specific parts of the library in JS if you need to.

### Dependency-free class name prefixing

daisyUI 5 can now prefix class names without a dependency.

### Micro CSS files for No-Build projects

For server-side rendered projects (Rails, Django, PHP, etc) or projects that don't have a JS build step (HTMX, Alpine.js, WordPress, etc), it's now possible to use specific parts of daisyUI without including the entire library or even without Tailwind CSS.

For example if you only want to use daisyUI toggle component, include a tiny CSS file that only contains the styles for the toggle component:

<div class="before-after">

```:Before
Not possible
```
```:After
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/components/toggle.css
```
</div>

All components, all themes, and basically every single part of daisyUI library [is now available as compressed. minified CSS files on CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/chunks.css).

Also, with the 75% smaller daisyui.css (formerly full.css) CDN file, it is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5.

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/cdn-micro-css-files.webp" alt="Tailwind CSS component library daisyui CDN file">

Check out the [CDN docs](/docs/cdn/) to customize the parts of the library you want to include in your project from the CDN.

### Include and Exclude parts of the library

Now for the first time, it's possible to include/exclude specific parts of daisyUI library. For example if you only want to use the "Toggle" component, you can include only the "Toggle" component and exclude everything else!

<div class="before-after">

```:Before
Not possible



```
```postcss:After
@plugin "daisyui" {
  include: toggle;
}
```
</div>
Or if you want to exclude a specific part of the library, you can do that too!
<div class="before-after">

```:Before
Not possible



```
```postcss:After
@plugin "daisyui" {
  exclude: scrollbar;
}
```
</div>

## 3. Design System Improvements

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – New "Effect" CSS variables.  
> Size improvements + new `xl` size modifier.  
> New component style modifiers: `*-soft` and `*-dash`.  
> Color format flexibility.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#4-themes-and-styling)

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/daisyui-theme-generator-effects.webp" alt="daisyui 5 noise effect and depth effect">

### New "Effect" CSS variables

daisyUI 5 introduces a new set of effects that can be enabled or disabled globally or per theme. These effects change the look and feel of relevant components, like buttons, checkbox, toggle, etc.

Currently, the following effects are available:
- `--depth`: adds a clean, subtle depth effect to the components, making them look more visually appealing
- `--noise`: adds a slight noise effect to the components, giving them a more textured look

These effects can be enabled or disabled using a CSS variable. Check out the new [Theme Generator](/theme-generator/) page to see how it works.


### New "X-Large" size
All components that previously had `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg` size modifiers now also support a new `xl` size modifier. This gives you more control over the size of components and allows you to create more flexible and responsive designs.

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/xl-button.webp" alt="daisyui tailwind xl button">

### Size scale improvements

With the addition of the new `xl` size modifier, the size scale of components has been adjusted to make it consistent. The new size scale is more harmonious and visually appealing.

In daisyUI 4, the size difference between sizes was not following a consistent scale.  
The new default size scale is consistent and more visually appealing ...and it's customizable!

| Button height scale | Before                                        | After                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `xs`                | 6  × 4 = 24px                                 | <span class="text-success">6</span>  × 4 = 24px |
| `sm`                | 8  × 4 = 32px                                 | <span class="text-success">8</span>  × 4 = 32px |
| `md`                | <span class="text-error">12</span> × 4 = 48px | <span class="text-success">10</span> × 4 = 40px |
| `lg`                | <span class="text-error">16</span> × 4 = 64px | <span class="text-success">12</span> × 4 = 48px |
| `xl`                | -                                             | <span class="text-success">14</span> × 4 = 56px |

| Checkbox height scale | Before                                       | After                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `xs`                  | 4  × 4 = 16px                                | <span class="text-success">4</span> × 4 = 16px |
| `sm`                  | 5  × 4 = 20px                                | <span class="text-success">5</span> × 4 = 20px |
| `md`                  | 6  × 4 = 24px                                | <span class="text-success">6</span> × 4 = 24px |
| `lg`                  | <span class="text-error">8</span> × 4 = 32px | <span class="text-success">7</span> × 4 = 28px |
| `xl`                  | -                                            | <span class="text-success">8</span> × 4 = 32px |

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/numbers-not-numbering.webp" alt="Numbers not Numbering">

### Size scale customization

Component size scales are now customizable. Previously, customizing the size of components required a lot of manual work.  
Now everything is tokenized with CSS variables, You can define the size scale of the components globally or per theme, making them shorter or taller, based on your design needs.

- `--size-field` variable is used to define the base size of fields like input, button, tab, etc.
- `--size-selector` variable is used to define the base size of selectors like checkbox, radio, toggle, badge, etc.

See how it works in the new [Theme Generator](/theme-generator/) page.

### Border size customization

Border size of buttons, inputs, tab, et are now customizable globally or per theme.

- `--border` variable is used to define the border size of components like button, input, tab, etc.

See how it works in the new [Theme Generator](/theme-generator/) page.

<img class="mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/daisyui-soft-button-dash-button.webp" alt="daisyui 5 soft button and dash button">

### New component styles: `soft`, `dash`

Components like `button`, `badge`, `alert` now have `soft` and `dash` styles.  
`soft` style makes the component look softer and `dash` style adds a dashed border to the component.

### All modifier classes are now responsive

daisyUI 5 makes all modifiers responsive by default. This means you can use responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, etc. with all component modifier classes, not just a selected few.

### Color format flexibility

daisyUI 5 supports all color formats and doesn't convert your colors to a specific format.

Before Tailwind CSS 4, color values of utility classes had to be generated at build time so the only way to have CSS variables for colors and being able to use Tailwind CSS opacity modifiers was to use a specific color format and pass it tailwind to generate the opacity variables.  
Tailwind CSS 4 now uses CSS variables for colors and `color-mix()` to control the opacity. This means we can use any color format we want and no transformation is needed.  
daisyUI built-in themes still use OKLCH color format and I would recommend using OKLCH for custom themes too, but you can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

## 4. Themes and styling

Themes and colors are what makes your website unique. We've made significant improvements to the themes and colors in daisyUI 5, including new themes, improved existing themes, and a new Theme Generator to help you create your own custom themes.

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/daisyui-5-new-themes.webp" alt="daisyui 5 new tailwind css themes">

### New themes

daisyUI 5 includes 3 new themes:

- `caramellatte` – Warm, cozy, light theme featuring brown and beige
- `abyss` – Deep dark green, teal and phosphorus color palette
- `silk` – Bright, clean and bold theme with fluorescent text colors

### Existing themes improvements

Most daisyUI themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.

<img class="w-lg mx-auto rounded-box" src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/new-theme-generator.webp" alt="tailwind css color generator">

### All-new Theme Generator

Check out the new [Theme Generator](/theme-generator/) page to create your own custom theme. Create, customize or extend themes, or generate stunning new themes using the new daisyUI color palette generator algorithm.

## 11. Breaking changes in design system

> :TLDR:
>
> Default sizes for some UI elements have been adjusted for improved consistency. They are also customizable now.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#12-breaking-changes-in-config)

- `btn`, `input`, `select` now have a smaller height by default [see size scale improvements](#size-scale-improvements)
- `checkbox`, `radio`, `toggle`, `range`, `rating` now have a smaller height by default [see size scale improvements](#size-scale-improvements)

You can customize the default size scale using the new `--size-field` and `--size-selector` CSS variables in your theme.  
Check out the new [Theme Generator](/theme-generator/) page to see it in action.

[Read the detailed changelog for each component](/docs/changelog/)  

## 12. Breaking changes in config

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – Use the new config format in the CSS file. No need for `tailwind.config.js` anymore.  
> The new config format is easier to use, it's more flexible, and it's more powerful.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#13-breaking-changes-in-themes)

- Tailwind CSS 4 allows config directly from the CSS file, so instead of `tailwind.config.js` you need to put the daisyUI config in the CSS file. [See the new config format](/docs/config/).
- `themes` config is a comma separated list of theme names. Read more about [daisyUI config](/docs/config/) and [daisyUI themes](/docs/themes/).
- `darkTheme` config was removed. Instead you can use `--prefersdark` flag directly in the `themes` list.
- `themeRoot` config was renamed to `root`.
- `styled: false` config was removed in favor of providing micro CSS files and the ability to include/exclude parts of the library. Disabling themes will remove all colors, but component are no longer distributed into two chunk of unstyled styled. You can now include/exclude each component individually.
- `base: false` config was removed in favor of include/exclude config where you can include/exclude each component individually.
- `utils: false` config was removed in favor of include/exclude config where you can include/exclude each component individually.

Read more about [daisyUI config](/docs/config/).

## 13. Breaking changes in themes

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – Automatic `*-content` color calculation is removed. Theme variable names have changed for better consistency and readability.  Previous themes are available for easy migration.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#14-bug-fixes)

Automatic `*-content` color calculation based on background color was removed. Now that Tailwind CSS supports CSS variables for colors, we no longer process and convert color values at build time. You can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

Most themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.  
If you prefer using the previous colors, I [prepared a repo, including all daisyUI 4 theme colors](https://github.com/daisyui/v4-themes-for-v5/) easy to copy/paste in daisyUI 5.

All color variable names have been changed to be aligned with new Tailwind CSS 4 syntax. And to be more readable and easier to customize [See the new color format](#improved-color-variables)

### Removed theme variables

- `--animation-btn` was removed (no longer needed)
- `--animation-input` was removed (no longer needed)
- `--btn-focus-scale` was removed (no longer needed)

### Theme custom fonts

Cyberpunk and Wireframe themes no longer have custom font by default. If you want the same v4 font for them, customize these themes like:

```postcss
@plugin "daisyui";

@plugin "daisyui/theme" {
  name: cyberpunk;
  font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Courier New, monospace;
}

@plugin "daisyui/theme" {
  name: wireframe;
  font-family: Chalkboard, comic sans ms, "sans-serif";
}
```

## 14. Bug fixes

> :TLDR:
>
> TLDR – More than 95% of all the open issues from daisyUI 4 have been fixed in this release.  
> [:FF: Skip to the next section](#15-get-started-with-daisyui-5)

Some of these bugs were fixed automatically by the new changes in changes in the core library, design system, themes, and components. Some of them became possible with the new capabilities of Tailwind CSS 4.  

And some of these bugs were related to a specific structure / style / behavior of components and changing them in a patch release would have caused breaking changes for all existing projects. We had to wait for the major release to apply these changes.  

If you've been waiting for a specific bug fix, here are the bugs that have been fixed in this release. Let me know if I miss any bug or let me know if a bug is closed by mistake 💚
