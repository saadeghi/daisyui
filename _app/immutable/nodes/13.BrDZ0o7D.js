This is an official Figma library that is maintained by the daisyUI, and includes all components and all themes and all features, fully tokenized and ready to use in your projects.</p> <p>Get the official daisyUI Figma Library from <a href="/store/">daisyUI Store</a></p> <p><a href="/store/"><img src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/blog/2024-wrapped-figma.webp" alt="daisyUI Figma Library"></a></p> <h2 id="new-templates-added"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#new-templates-added"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>New templates added</h2> <p>This year we released Nexus - a multi-page fully featured admin dashboard template, Documentation template, Blog template.<br> All made by daisyUI, available in <a href="/store/">daisyUI Store</a>.</p> <h2 id="accessibility-improvements"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#accessibility-improvements"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Accessibility improvements</h2> <p>We received lots of feedbacks and contributions to make the documentation more informative and to improve the accessibility of code examples. Notes and comments were added to the relevant sections to provide more context and to help you understand the examples better. Necessary aria attributes and roles were added to the relevant code examples to make them accessible for screen readers and keyboard navigation by default when you copy and paste them to your project.</p> <h2 id="keeping-it-compatible"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#keeping-it-compatible"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Keeping it compatible</h2> <p>No developer wants unexpected visual changes after a dependency update. In 2024, we prioritized stability by separating visual changes from functional bug fixes. Major visual updates were reserved for v5 (coming soon). In daisyUI 4 we also made sure older browsers would have fallback for new CSS features like OKLCH colors, until the majority of users have updated their browsers to the latest versions. This helped the incremental adoption of new CSS features in daisyUI.</p> <h2 id="discord-server-launch"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#discord-server-launch"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Discord server launch</h2> <p>The daisyUI Discord server was launched in 2024 to provide a place for the community to ask questions, share their projects, and get help from other developers.
