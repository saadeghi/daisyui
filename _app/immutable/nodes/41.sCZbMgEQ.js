Modern JavaScript component libraries like Radix UI and React Aria promise better developer experience, but they introduce significant overhead when building at scale. Each <a href="/pages/css-library-for-html/" title="CSS Library for HTML">component library</a> brings massive dependencies and complexity that compounds as your application grows.</p> <p>Even minimal libraries like Radix UI require substantial JavaScript bundles. React Aria components need complex state management, focus handling, and accessibility implementations that add layers of abstraction. When you're building enterprise applications with hundreds of components and multiple teams, these abstractions become liabilities rather than benefits.</p> <p>The dependency chains run deep. Modern libraries create intricate webs of packages, each introducing potential security vulnerabilities, version conflicts, and maintenance overhead. A single broken dependency can break your entire application, and keeping everything updated becomes a full-time job.</p> <p>JavaScript component libraries also create framework lock-in that becomes problematic at scale. Large applications often need different technologies for different purposes - React for complex dashboards, Vue for customer-facing interfaces, vanilla JavaScript for landing pages. When your component library only works with one framework, you're forced to make suboptimal technology choices or maintain multiple design systems.</p> <div class="has-[.code-tab]:my-4 overflow-x-auto [direction:ltr]"><!></div> <p>This framework dependency creates problems when you need technology diversity. Enterprise applications often require different frameworks for different parts - React for admin dashboards, Vue for customer portals, vanilla JavaScript for landing pages. When your component library only works with one framework, you're forced into suboptimal architectural decisions or maintaining multiple design systems.</p> <p>Modern JavaScript component libraries also add significant build complexity. Even with tools like Vite and Turbopack, the processing required for JavaScript components, CSS-in-JS systems, and complex dependency resolution creates friction in development workflows. Build tools need to understand framework-specific patterns, handle dynamic imports, and process styling systems that change at runtime.</p> <p>The runtime overhead compounds these problems. Every component render involves virtual DOM diffing, JavaScript execution, style injection, and event handler binding. Complex component trees accumulate memory over time, and JavaScript-driven animations struggle to maintain smooth performance across different devices and browsers.</p> <p>Security becomes a major concern with large dependency trees. Every package in your component library's dependency chain represents a potential attack vector. Security audits frequently reveal vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, and keeping everything patched becomes an ongoing maintenance burden that scales with your dependency count.</p> <h2 id="why-the-platform-is-the-answer"><a href="#why-the-platform-is-the-answer" class="no-underline" aria-label="Link to heading"><span class="heading-anchorlink-icon bg-base-content/5 hover:bg-primary/10 size-[1em] text-base-content/30 hover:text-primary/50 rounded-field border border-base-content/5 hover:border-primary/20 inline-grid place-content-center hover:shadow-sm hover:shadow-base-200 align-text-bottom me-3 lg:absolute lg:ms-[-1.5em] lg:mt-1 transition-all group"><svg class="group-hover:scale-100 scale-90 transition-transform" fill="currentColor" width=".5em" height=".5em" viewBox="0 0 256 256" id="Flat" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M216,148H172V108h44a12,12,0,0,0,0-24H172V40a12,12,0,0,0-24,0V84H108V40a12,12,0,0,0-24,0V84H40a12,12,0,0,0,0,24H84v40H40a12,12,0,0,0,0,24H84v44a12,12,0,0,0,24,0V172h40v44a12,12,0,0,0,24,0V172h44a12,12,0,0,0,0-24Zm-108,0V108h40v40Z"></path></svg></span></a>Why the platform is the answer</h2> <p>Modern web standards have evolved to handle most UI needs without heavy JavaScript libraries. CSS has become incredibly powerful, with features that eliminate the need for JavaScript in many cases:</p> <div class="has-[.code-tab]:my-4 overflow-x-auto [direction:ltr]"><!></div> <p>These features handle most common UI patterns without requiring JavaScript execution.</p> <p>Semantic HTML elements provide built-in accessibility and functionality that works perfectly across browsers, screen readers, and mobile devices. Native form validation, disclosure widgets, and date pickers require no JavaScript while providing better user experiences than custom implementations.</p> <div class="has-[.code-tab]:my-4 overflow-x-auto [direction:ltr]"><!></div> <p>Platform-native solutions deliver better performance through zero JavaScript execution cost, aggressive CSS caching, and smaller bundle sizes.

Framework agnosticism becomes crucial when you're building complex systems that need different technologies for different purposes. Real enterprise applications typically involve:</p> <div class="has-[.code-tab]:my-4 overflow-x-auto [direction:ltr]"><!></div> <p>Each part might use different frameworks based on team expertise, performance requirements, third-party integrations, and legacy constraints. Framework-agnostic styling ensures consistency across this technology diversity. The same CSS classes work everywhere, ensuring visual consistency across your entire ecosystem:</p> <div class="has-[.code-tab]:my-4 overflow-x-auto [direction:ltr]"><!></div> <p>Framework-agnostic tools also reduce hiring constraints and increase team flexibility. You can hire the best developers regardless of framework expertise, and developers can move between projects easily since core UI knowledge applies everywhere.
