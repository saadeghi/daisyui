Itâ€™s a set of additional component classes that you can use in your HTML files.</p> <p>For example, to make a button with daisyUI, you write following HTML code:</p> <pre class="language-html"><!></pre> <p>With Tailwind UI, you need to use Tailwind CSS utility classes to make a button:</p> <pre class="language-html"><!></pre> <p>Basically Tailwind UI is a set of HTML templates that you can copy and paste into your project while daisyUI is a plug-in which adds super powers to Tailwind CSS.</p> <h2 id="pricing-and-costs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pricing-and-costs"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Pricing and costs</h2> <p>Tailwind UI is a <a href="https://tailwindui.com/all-access" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commercial product</a>. You need to purchase a personal license ($299) or team license ($799) to use it in your projects.</p> <p>daisyUI is free and open source. You can use it in your personal and commercial projects. However if you want to support the project, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/daisyui" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donate to the project</a> ðŸ’š</p> <h2 id="customization"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#customization"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Customization</h2> <p>Both daisyUI and Tailwind UI are customizable. You can change the design of components using utility classes.</p> <h2 id="dark-mode-and-themes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#dark-mode-and-themes"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Dark mode and themes</h2> <p>Tailwind UI only comes as it is. To add a dark mode or to change the colors, you need to add more utility classes to the components.</p> <p>daisyUI comes with a built-in dark mode and also 28 other built-in themes. All the themes work out of the box and you donâ€™t need to add any extra classes to your components. You can also <a href="https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">create your own daisyUI theme</a> in seconds.</p> <h2 id="html-size"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#html-size"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>HTML size</h2> <p>Generally using Tailwind CSS utility classes makes your HTML files bigger. You need to add a lot of classes to your elements to style them.
With daisyUI, you write 80% fewer class names and your HTML size will be about 70% smaller.</p> <h2 id="css-size-and-unused-styles"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#css-size-and-unused-styles"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>CSS size and unused styles</h2> <p>Both daisyUI and Tailwind UI use Tailwind CSS under the hood. Tailwind UI uses the same utility classes from Tailwind CSS. daisyUI uses component classes which are added as a plug-in. However, both get compiled by Tailwind CSS and the final CSS file will only include the used classes, free of any unused CSS rules.</p> <h2 id="javascript-and-interactivity"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#javascript-and-interactivity"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>JavaScript and interactivity</h2> <p>Some components in Tailwind UI are interactive and they need JavaScript to work.</p> <p>daisyUI however, is a dev-dependency. It doesnâ€™t need any JavaScript to work. Itâ€™s a pure CSS component library and it works just well even if JavaScript is disabled on the browsers. daisyUI provides some interactive components which are possible with CSS only.</p> <p>daisyUI doesnâ€™t include interactive elements that need JS (for example a date picker). However, you can use any JS library with daisyUI. Headless libraries like <a href="https://headlessui.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Headless UI</a> or <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radix primitives</a> are recommended. You can also use any other JS plug-in that you like and you can add daisyUI classes or color values to them so they would fit your website design.</p> <h2 id="accessibility"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#accessibility"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Accessibility</h2> <p>Both daisyUI and Tailwind UI provide CSS and HTML code that is accessible by default.
The colors and design of components are chosen in a way that they are accessible for everyone.
However, accessibility is not binary and itâ€™s not installable. You should always test your website for accessibility issues and fix them according to your customer needs and the way they use your website.</p> <h2 id="frameworks-and-libraries"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#frameworks-and-libraries"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Frameworks and libraries</h2> <ul><li>Taiwlind UI is a set of HTML sections and however the interactive parts are only available for React and Vue (at the time of writing this article).</li> <li>daisyUI is framework agnostic. Itâ€™s just CSS and you can use it with any framework or library.</li></ul> <p>You can use third-party JS plugins or even handle the JS interactivity yourself on both daisyUI and Tailwind UI.</p> <h2 id="which-one-should-you-use"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#which-one-should-you-use"><span class="mr-1 opacity-20 hover:opacity-60 text-base font-bold inline-block align-middle relative -mt-1">#</span></a>Which one should you use?</h2> <p>daisyUI and Tailwind UI are both great component libraries. They both provide well-designed components for your web pages.
However, to choose the best one for your project, you need to consider your project requirements and your teamâ€™s skills.</p> <p>Tailwind UI is better if:</p> <ul><li>Youâ€™re using React or Vue</li> <li>Youâ€™re willing to pay for personal or team license</li> <li>You want to copy paste sections of HTML code into your project</li> <li>You want a single design to use everywhere</li></ul> <p>daisyUI is better if:</p> <ul><li>You want a free and open source component library</li> <li>You want to easily change the theme and look of your website</li> <li>You want to use a component library that is customizable and themeable</li> <li>You want to have multiple themes available</li> <li>Youâ€™re using any framework or library (or even no JS at all)</li> <li>You want to ship less JS to the browser</li> <li>You want to keep your HTML clean</li></ul>`,1);const C={title:"daisyUI vs. Tailwind UI",desc:"Which one is better?
